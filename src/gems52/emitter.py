"""Metric-exact emission: maximum-expected-coverage packing of a belief field.

Why this module exists
----------------------
``docs/research/score-ceiling-analysis.md`` §2 records the defect that this module repairs.
The superseded rule (``gems52-h19-5-smoothmaxcov-44090``) blurred the binary ridge by
``sigma = 1.85 px`` and then ran a max-coverage greedy on the blurred image.  Blurring a 1-px
binary ridge lowers and *shifts* its peak, so the greedy spread mass across the blurred blob
instead of locking onto the crest.  Measured consequence on the only real truth raster in this
competition (``labels.tif``, 60,988 catalogue pixels):

    rule                        dots   off-field dots   credit / unit mass   catalogue-proxy DTI
    incumbent raster-order     44,090          0             0.2154               0.1617720
    smoothmaxcov-44090         44,090     25,485 (57.8%)    0.0213               0.0163197

A 10x collapse in credit per unit of emitted mass, at identical budget.  The cause is arithmetic,
not geological: **mass placed outside the belief field's own support cannot earn credit from any
truth consistent with the belief.**

What this module guarantees
---------------------------
1. **Support confinement.**  Every emitted pixel is a pixel the belief field nominates
   (``field > 0``).  Emitting off-support is never defensible under the field's own beliefs, and
   it is the exact failure mode measured above.
2. **Exact marginal gain.**  For a candidate ``x`` the gain used for acceptance is

       dT(x) = sum_delta field(x+delta) * max(0, k(delta) - C(x+delta))

   where ``C`` is the credit already delivered by the accepted set and ``k`` is the official
   triangular kernel.  ``C`` is tracked so that overlapping dots are never double-credited.
   This is the exact *incremental* credit; the naive ``sum_delta field(x+delta) k(delta)``
   over-counts and is what makes a max-coverage sweep scatter.
3. **The metric's own stopping rule.**  A candidate is accepted only while the exact marginal
   theorem of ``metric.py`` holds:

       accept  <=>  dT * D > alpha * T * (dT + 1 - kbar)

   with ``kbar = sum_delta field(x+delta) k(delta)`` the expected kernel proximity that sets the
   added false-positive mass ``1 - kbar``.  The theorem is verified against brute force in
   ``tests/test_emitter.py``.

Algorithm
---------
**Lazy greedy** (Minoux / Cormode et al.) on the exact marginal gain, not on the static upper
bound.  A max-heap holds one key per support pixel; the key is re-validated against the live gain
on pop and re-pushed if stale.  Only pixels within `2R` of a new dot can have changed gain, so an
acceptance costs one local re-evaluation sweep, and on the sparse 1-px H19-5 ridge that is a
handful of support pixels rather than 169.

*Why not a static-order sweep:* the first version of this module ranked candidates by the static
upper bound `(field correlate k)(x)` and accepted in that order.  On a straight 1-px ridge every
interior pixel has the **same** static bound, so the sweep accepted adjacent pixels and delivered
**10.0 of the 15.0** units of credit the exact greedy delivered at the same budget — a 33 %
shortfall, i.e. a milder version of the very defect this module exists to repair.
`tests/test_emitter.py::test_lazy_greedy_matches_exact_greedy` pins that down.

Complexity: `O(|support| log|support| + budget * neighbours)`, which is a few seconds for the
121,131-px H19-5 support on 2 vCPU (measured: 4.2 s at a 44,090-px budget).
